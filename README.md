## Overview

We extend FL into a horizontal peer-to-peer (P2P) structure and introduce our P2PFL framework: EPFLU. EPFLU transitions the paradigms from vertical FL to horizontal P2P structure from the user perspective and incorporates personalized enhancement techniques using private information. Through horizontal consensus information aggregation and private information supplementation, EPFLU solves the weakness of traditional FL that dilutes the characteristics of individual client data and leads to model deviation. This structural transformation also significantly alleviates the original communication issues. Additionally, EPFLU has a customized simulation evaluation framework to make it more suitable for real-world large-scale IoT. Within this framework, we conducted detailed experiments of selected baselines against EPFLU on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results demonstrate that EPFLU can consistently converge to the best performance under extreme data distribution scenarios.
