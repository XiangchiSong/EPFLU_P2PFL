## Overview

We extend FL into a horizontal peer-to-peer (P2P) structure and introduce our P2PFL framework: Efficient Peer-to-peer Federated Learning for Users (EPFLU). EPFLU transitions the paradigms from vertical FL to horizontal P2P structure from the user perspective and incorporates personalized enhancement techniques using private information. Through horizontal consensus information aggregation and private information supplementation, EPFLU solves the weakness of traditional FL that dilutes the characteristics of individual client data and leads to model deviation. This structural transformation also significantly alleviates the original communication issues. Additionally, EPFLU has a customized simulation evaluation framework to make it more suitable for real-world large-scale IoT. Within this framework, we design extreme data distribution scenarios and conduct detailed experiments of EPFLU and selected baselines on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results demonstrate that the robust and adaptive EPFLU framework can consistently converge to optimal performance even under extreme data distribution scenarios. We choose FedAvg[1], FedAdam[2,3] and PPT[4] as baselines. Compared with the selected vertical aggregation and horizontal transmission cumulative aggregation methods, EPFLU achieves communication improvements of 21% and 57% respectively.

## Model & Parameter Settings

### Model Settings

#### Classification Structure
- A fully connected (FC) layer with 200 neurons.
- A batch normalization (BN) layer.
- A second FC layer also with 200 neurons.
- A softmax output layer to generate the final classification probabilities.
#### CNN Model 
Following the methodologies employed in the MTFL[2] work, the CNN architecture includes:
- A 3x3 convolutional (conv) layer with 32 filters, followed by BN, ReLU activation, and a 2x2 max pooling.
- A second 3x3 convolutional ReLU layer with 64 filters, accompanied by BN, ReLU activation, and a 2x2 max pooling.
- A ReLU activated FC layer with 512 neurons.
- A softmax output layer for classification.
#### Model communication & computation Parameter Settings
EPFLU sets the storage space occupied by the number of parameters of the deep learning model as the model communication size:
- `comm_datasize = 6400320 bit` representing the MINST Model size (approximately 781.29 KB) in bits.
- `comm_datasize = 67758080 bit` representing the CIFAR Model size (approximately 8273 KB or 8.1 MB) in bits.

EPFLU considers the amount of data involved in processing a single iteration or single data sample as the local computation size:
- `local_datasize = 6272 bit` for MINST data size (784 B) in bits.
- `local_datasize = 24576 bit` for CIFAR data size (approximately 3072 B or 3 KB) in bits.

### EPFLU-P2PFL Parameter Settings
The configuration for EPFLU-P2PFL is specified as follows:
- **Data Distribution Type (iid)**: Options include `1` for balanced-iid, `2` for balanced-non-iid, `3` for imbalanced-non-iid, and `4` for imbalanced-mixed-iid.
- **Algorithm (alg)**: Choices are `fedavg`, `fedadam`, `ppt`, `epflu`.
- **Total Workers (W)**: `500`, suitable for a large-scale IoT scenario.
- **Total Rounds (T)**: `300` rounds for CIFAR10 to verify performance and convergence, `50` rounds for MNIST to validate communication.
- **Sampling Rate (C)**: `0.3`, the best sampling rate after balancing training and communication costs under the large-scale IoT environment setting.
- **Client Learning Rate (lr)**: Different settings for different algorithms and datasets, e.g., `0.02` for CIFAR10 and `0.2` for MNIST with FedAvg; `0.05` for CIFAR10 and `0.2` for MNIST with FedAdam; `0.03` for CIFAR10 and `0.2` for MNIST with PPT; `0.001` for CIFAR10 and `0.001` for MNIST with EPFLU;
  
### Communication Simulator Parameter Settings
The simulation setup for communication parameters is as follows:
- **Bandwidth (B)**: `20 MHz` (2e7 Hz), representing typical bandwidths for LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi.
- **Reference Channel Gain (g0)**: `1e-8`, representing the gain at a distance of one unit.
- **Transmitter Power (p)**: `0.5 Watts`.
- **Noise Power (sigma)**: `1e-10 Watts`.
- **Number of CPU Cycles per Bit (c)**: `10800`. This metric is adapted from GPU's "floating-point operations per second" (FLOPS) to simulate the scenario using CPUs for a large-scale IoT environment.
- **CPU Frequency (f)**: `1 GHz` (1e9 cycles per second), configured for an i7-9700K CPU at 3.60 GHz.
- **Effective Switch Capacitance (alpha)**: `2e-28` Joules per cycle squared.
- **Distance Threshold**: `200`, ensuring the reference channel gain does not drop to zero.
- **Communication to Cloud Cost Multiplier**: `1.5`, assuming that vertical FL communication costs are 1.5 times that of horizontal P2P communication. Previous work on communication latency to the cloud, **HierFAVG**[5] assumes that it is **10** times larger than that to the edge.
- **Dynamic Multiplier**: Adjusted based on a reference average distance of `50` units.
- **Extra Loss**: `10`, this is an assumed value, adjusted based on actual conditions.
- **Minimum Channel Gain to Cloud (min_g_2C)**: `5e-11`.
- **Minimum Channel Gain P2P (min_g_P2P)**: `1e-10`.
- **Distance Matrix**: A random distance matrix representing the distances between edge clients, ranging from `1 to 100`.

## Dataset Distribution Operation Detail
### Core Concepts
- **Data Shards**: A shard represents a subset of the dataset. Managing the number and distribution of shards across clients is crucial for controlling the IID (independent and identically distributed) or non-IID nature of data across the network. 

### Parameter Settings and Their Impact
- **Number of Shards (n_shards)**: Dictates how the data is divided. More shards mean a finer granularity in control over data distribution.
- **Number of Workers (W)**: Represents the total number of clients or nodes participating in the federated learning. Each worker will receive a portion of the total shards.
- **Shard Allocation**:
  - **Balanced**: Each client receives an equal number of shards.
  - **Imbalanced**: Clients receive a varying number of shards, which simulates real-world scenarios where data isn't uniformly distributed across nodes.

### Operational Details
- **Shard Assignment**:
  - For IID setups, shards are assigned randomly.
  - For non-IID setups, shards are assigned based on specific patterns or rules, such as clustering similar classes together or ensuring that each client receives shards from only a few classes.
- **Min and Max Shards per Client**: These parameters define the range of shards that each client can receive, crucial for imbalanced setups.
  
### Distribution Types
- **Balanced IID (Type 1)**: Data is shuffled and evenly distributed among all clients, mimicking an IID scenario. This is often used for benchmarking because of its simplicity and fairness.
- **Balanced Non-IID (Type 2)**: Involves sorting the data by class labels and then splitting it into shards that are distributed such that each client receives a predefined set of shards. This setup helps in creating scenarios where each client gets a diverse but non-representative sample of the overall dataset. We firstly sorted by class labels and then divided into `2 * W` shards.
- **Imbalanced Non-IID (Type 3)**: Clients receive shards in a manner that varies significantly in terms of data quantity and class representation, thus creating an imbalanced data distribution among the clients. This setting is more realistic and challenging as it tests the robustness of the federated algorithms under non-ideal conditions. In this configuration, the number of shards each client receives can range from 1 to 5, creating a highly variable data distribution. We used the parameters `min_shards_per_client = 1` and `max_shards_per_client = 2` in the EPFLU settings.
- **Imbalanced Mixed-IID (Type 4)**: A hybrid approach where a fraction of the clients receive data in an IID fashion, while the rest receive data non-IID. This setup can be used to simulate environments where different nodes have different data visibility and availability. We used `50%` of clients (calculated as `0.5 * W`) receive data in an IID distribution, and the remaining `50%` receive data non-IID. The non-IID portion follows the imbalanced non-IID strategy. After we created the Mixed-IID scenario, We used the parameters `min_shards_per_client = 1` and `max_shards_per_client = 2` to create an imbalanced amount of data between clients, just like Type3 does in EPFLU.

### Implementation Tips
- Ensuring consistency in shard assignment between training and testing datasets `specific_assignments=train_assign` is critical for maintaining the validity of the model evaluation.
- Using seed values for random operations helps in reproducing experiments and verifying results. We used `42` in imbalanced_non_iid and imbalanced_mixed_iid scenarios.

The configuration of these parameters significantly influences the learning dynamics and the effectiveness of the federated learning models. Adjusting them according to the specific needs of the deployment scenario can lead to better model performance and more robust insights.
